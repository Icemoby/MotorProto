classdef Solver < Parameterizable
    %Solver.m Base class for all solvers.
    %
    % Solver properties:
    %   Matrices           - MatrixFactory objects used by the solver
    %   TimePoints         - Target number of simulation time points
    %   Times              - The simulation times used by the solver
    %   Verbose            - Toggles verbose simulation progress reports
    %   X                  - The solution produced by the solver
    %   X_t                - Time derivative of the solver solution
    %   SimulationTime     - Total simulation time
    %   ConvergenceHistory - Relative residual history
    %
    % Solver methods:
    %   solve - Run the simulation

properties:
 	%TimePoints - Target number of simulation time points
 	%	The TimePoints property is an integer that sets the target number
 	%   of time points used in the simulation. This number is not adhered
 	%   to exactley but used as a guide to determine an appropriate number
 	%   of time points to use after considering harmonic content of the
 	%   solution and the effects of aliasing. In general, the number of
 	%   time points used will be greater than that specified in the
 	%   TimePoints, but not much larger.
